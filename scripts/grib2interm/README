This document contains directions on how to convert ERA Grib files to WRF Intermediate files
that can be used to create Met files. 

0) CHECK GRIB AND WRF INTERMEDIATE FILES
Grib files are in /shared-projects/wps-inputs/metfiles/era5-grib/north-america/grib, and WRF
 Intermediate files are in
 /shared-projects/wps-inputs/metfiles/era5-grib/north-america/wrf_intermediate
 Make sure that the grib files have been downloaded for your dates of interest,
 and that corresponding wrf intermediate files have not been created.

1) EDIT JOB SUBMISSION SCRIPT
Typically, we convert multiple months of data at once. Even if we want data for only one
month (e.g. January), you need the first day of data from Feburary to run WRF files as
we currently have them set up. If you only need one specific month of data, edit
submit_grib2interm_single.sh, otherwise edit submit_grib2interm_batch.sh. The batch
submission script converts multiple months of data at once in parallel by calling
grib_to_interm.py multiple times.

This script must manually be edited with one call per line. Let's say we want to run WRF
Jan-01-17 --> Mar-31-17. The body of the script would look as follows.

```
srun -n 1 python grib_to_interm.py 2017-01-01 2017-02-01 &
srun -n 1 python grib_to_interm.py 2017-02-01 2017-03-01 &
srun -n 1 python grib_to_interm.py 2017-03-01 2017-04-01 &
srun -n 1 python grib_to_interm.py 2017-04-01 2017-04-02 &
```

Make sure you edit `ntasks` within the job submission script to equal the number of
months of analysis, 4 in this example. If you only want one month, go to the
`..._single...` script and call without the &

```
srun -n 1 python grib_to_interm.py 2017-01-01 2017-02-01
```



2) SUBMIT SCRIPT
Submit the script by calling `sbatch submit_grib2interm_single.sh`. Upon completion,
you will have WRF Intermediate files in /shared-projects/.
